Hi there!


I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data science, aiming to be hired by the end of 2020.  
This repository is for completed projects and code snippets from [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)  

Quote:
> "Welcome to Google's Python Class -- this is a free class for people with a little bit of
> programming experience who want to learn Python. The class includes written materials,>

> are used within Google to introduce Python to people who have just a little programming 
> experience. The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, 
> building up to the later exercises which are full programs dealing with text files,
> processes, and http connections. The class is geared for people who have a little bit of
> programming experience in some language, enough to know what a "variable" or "if 
> statement" is. Beyond that, you do not need to be an expert programmer to use this
> material". 


List of files:
1. my_hello.py -- script to print 'Hello World!' or use a command line argument to greet a user with his name provided as a command line argument.
2. my_string.py --



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding skills or will be just fun for you to play with.
